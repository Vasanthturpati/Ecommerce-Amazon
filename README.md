This project is a basic Amazon Clone webpage built with HTML and CSS. It replicates the front-end layout and design of Amazon's homepage, including the header, product sections, and footer. The goal of this project was to practice HTML and CSS skills and understand website layout techniques.

I built this project following a tutorial by Apna College on their YouTube channel.
